## api.animeVideoHandler([id])
---

*To get the videos (mp4) of each chapter, you only need to use the `api.animeVideoHandler` function that receives the id of the episode as a parameter.* 
*To verify the id of each episode, look at the episodes property:*

```json
 "episodes": [
    {
      "id": "tokyo-ghoul/episode/episode-1"
    },
    {
      "id": "tokyo-ghoul/episode/episode-2"
    },
    {
      "id": "tokyo-ghoul/episode/episode-3"
    },
    {
      "id": "tokyo-ghoul/episode/episode-4"
    },
    {
      "id": "tokyo-ghoul/episode/episode-5"
    },
    {
      "id": "tokyo-ghoul/episode/episode-6"
    },
    {
      "id": "tokyo-ghoul/episode/episode-7"
    },
    {
      "id": "tokyo-ghoul/episode/episode-8"
    },
    {
      "id": "tokyo-ghoul/episode/episode-9"
    },
    {
      "id": "tokyo-ghoul/episode/episode-10"
    },
    {
      "id": "tokyo-ghoul/episode/episode-11"
    },
    {
      "id": "tokyo-ghoul/episode/episode-12"
    }
  ]
```

*You just have to pass the `id` of the episode*

```javascript
api.animeVideoHandler('tokyo-ghoul/episode/episode-12')
  .then(res =>{
    console.log(res)
});
```

```json
// 20191209122332
// http://localhost:5000/api/v1/AnimeVideoHandler/tokyo-ghoul/episode/episode-12

{
  "video": [
    {
      "mp4": "http://st8.anime1.com/[HorribleSubs] Tokyo Ghoul - 12 [480p]_a1.mp4?st=5qJfe7rxHaGYg-8w0sJX5A&e=1575926181"
    }
  ]
}
```

*Now you just need to use the `mp4` property of each `episodes id` and pass it to the video element*

```html
<video width="400" controls>
  <source src="http://st8.anime1.com/[HorribleSubs] Tokyo Ghoul - 12 [480p]_a1.mp4?st=5qJfe7rxHaGYg-8w0sJX5A&e=1575926181" type="video/mp4">

With the fate of the world in balance, the kingdom of Melromarc summons these legendary figures; in modern-day Japan, the call is answered, and the unwitting heroes are transported to this fantasy universe.\n\nThrust into Melromarc and given the title of \"Shield Hero,\" otaku Naofumi Iwatani is labeled the weakest due to his lack of offensive capability and apparent inexperience. When the heroes part ways to start their journeys, he only has one willing companion: the beautiful princess Malty Melromarc. However, she soon betrays him, steals all his money, and accuses him of taking advantage of her.\n\nFor his alleged crimes, Naofumi is branded a criminal and made outcast of society. With hatred filling his heart, he sets out alone, vowing vengeance against those who wronged him.",
